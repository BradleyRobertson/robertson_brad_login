<h1> # robertson_brad_login </h1>

The user login screen is designed to be very sleek and have a nightmode type asthetic with a black background and white text.

The admin login page asks for the input of name and password, and the adminstrator panel displays the time, greets the user by username, then displys the last login. This is used by simply echoing the date, username and calling upon the database for the last_login timestamp.
